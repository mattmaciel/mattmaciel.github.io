## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-last workflow (yeah I know this is the worst)

### What I learned

This is my first front end project, was very nice to work on that and discover all the particular properties of CSS.
it was very challenging for me, but I think that the result was good.

### Useful resources

- [Origamid - Guia Completo Flexbox ](https://www.origamid.com/projetos/flexbox-guia-completo/) - This helped me to understand how flexbox works and all details about that.
